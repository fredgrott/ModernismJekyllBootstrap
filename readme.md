ModernismJekyllBootstrap
========================

# Introduction

PlusJade no longer maintainsJekyllBootstrap so this is a softfork
of JekyllBootstrap updating it for both Modernism look and feel and 
to use Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.

Styles, there are two modernism styles included. Style one is more 
conservative in that some modernism elements are used within the
Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 context. The more radical style gets rid 
of the menu bar and footer stuff and goes into full bown 
zones for a dashboard style menu and is more focused on content 
being the center of attention.

In JekyllBootstrap theme syntax these styles are broken out as 
modernism andmodernism_radical.
